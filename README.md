# Hanu Dixit — Quantum-safe SMPC • Cybersecurity • PM

I bridge **research → product** in quantum-safe secure multi-party computation (SMPC) and security tools—turning papers, intel workflows, and compliance needs into working demos, dashboards, and docs.

**Value pillars**
- **Research → Product:** rapid prototyping, clean docs, measurable demos  
- **Security & Compliance:** SMPC, PSI, secure aggregation, **NIST 800-171** awareness  
- **Program Management:** scope → plan → ship; KPIs, audit trails, investor-ready visibility

## Featured Work
- **SENTINEL-QSMPC** — Mission Control dashboard with **PSI/Secure Aggregation** flows and a compliance panel; built to show investor-grade KPIs and auditability. ROI: faster trust-building in security reviews with runnable demos.  
  Repo: https://github.com/hanudixit/SENTINEL-QSMPC

- **sentinel-demo** — 60-second **PSI hashed-set** demo for cybersecurity: intersect two hashed indicator lists (e.g., credential dumps / watchlists) using client-only code; CI runs the demo to prove “it ships.”
