### üëã About Me

Quantum-focused Research Engineer with 3+ years across research, operations, and CRM. I translate quantum-safe cybersecurity concepts into clear requirements, SOPs, dashboards, and KPI reports, driving delivery in Agile/Waterfall and building quick Python prototypes/simulations.

Beyond quantum research, I bring experience as an IT Project Coordinator and Business Analyst, adept at optimizing processes and leading teams.
